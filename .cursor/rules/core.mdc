# Core Principles

-   Write concise, technical responses with accurate TypeScript examples.
-   Use functional, declarative programming. Avoid classes.
-   Prefer iteration and modularization over duplication.
-   Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
-   Use lowercase with dashes for directories (e.g., components/auth-wizard).
-   Favor named exports for components.
-   Use the Receive an Object, Return an Object (RORO) pattern.

# TypeScript

-   Use "function" keyword for pure functions. Omit semicolons.
-   Use TypeScript for all code. Prefer interfaces over types.
-   Avoid unnecessary curly braces in conditional statements.
-   For single-line statements in conditionals, omit curly braces.
-   Use concise, one-line syntax for simple conditional statements (e.g., if (condition) doSomething()).

# Error Handling

-   Use early returns for error conditions.
-   Use guard clauses to handle preconditions and invalid states early.
-   Implement proper error logging and user-friendly error messages.
